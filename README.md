# HTML-CSS-Tooling-Sass

I found Sass pretty useful at times. I like that it saves time for repeated classes and such.

I built a small website using Sass and it can be viewed here : https://nostalgic-allen-acb301.netlify.app/index.html

Code available here on Github : https://github.com/asgeiringvars/html-css-sass

There are comments in the code that divide the sections.
